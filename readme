# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

[What's the Weather in...?](https://kalebritt.github.io/)weather-api-hw6/

Description
Using dynamic Javascript, I have built this app which enables the user to check the weather for any city of their choice. The app displays the current weather as well as a 5-day forecase. Weather features are temperature, wind speed, humidity, and UV index. An icon is also displayed indicating if weather is cloudy, clear, etc.
